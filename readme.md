# Quoter

The project consists of a cli-tool that will retrieve a random quote, upon using the command "quotify", to lighten up your terminal as you work and possibly provide that spark of inspiration that's been eluding you.# Quoter

Quoter is CLI tool, when installed globally, will print quotes on design from Martin Scorsese to Pablo Picaso to the console.
Type 'Quoter', see the quote, simple as that.
